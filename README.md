Put your README here. Answer the following questions.

* What does the model you have implemented do and when should it be used?
* How did you test your model to determine if it is working reasonably correctly?
* What parameters have you exposed to users of your implementation in order to tune performance? 
* Are there specific inputs that your implementation has trouble with? Given more time, could you work around these or is it fundamental?
